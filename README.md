**Goal**: Create a data news wire.

Currently, this is the completed version of an mini-Google Alerts I created for a homework problem set focusing on OOP. 

Most of what I wrote is going to be in ps6.py, and that's the meat of this script. There are triggers located in triggers.txt for customizating it to fire when a word or phrase is located in the headline, summary or subject. Additional logic allows for creating simple 'and', 'or' and 'not' conditions for triggers.
